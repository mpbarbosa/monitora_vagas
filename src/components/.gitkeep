# Future React Components

This directory is reserved for future React component implementations.

## Purpose

When the project migrates from vanilla JavaScript to React, component files will be organized here.

## Planned Structure

```

│   ├── Input/
│   └── Card/
├── features/         # Feature-specific components
│   ├── HotelSearch/
